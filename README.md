PorqueBox
=========

Like TorqueBox, but for PHP. So PorqueBox.

Project Status: On hold
==============

Overall, the application server is somewhat functional.  Stock Quercus has ClassLoader problems with this, though.  Patching Quercus gets around that. Regardless, stock Quercus can't run all of Drupal 7 which is the primary application of interest for me.  By the time Quercus is compatible, I expect I'll want it to run Drupal 8.

Road Map
========

* Use TorqueBox code as a guide for implementing a deployment process for php applications in JBoss.
* Start exposing JBoss services to PorqueBox.
